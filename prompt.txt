 You are a senior engineering hiring manager designing AI-native assessments. Given these five stages, generate one realistic interview question per stage. Each question should align with the stated measures. Output
     exactly five labeled questions.

        Assessment stages and measures:

        1. Prompt-to-Prototype take-home
           • Measures: prompt clarity; correctness & test depth; code hygiene

        2. Live debugging drill
           • Measures: hypothesis loop speed; AI usage for root cause; safety nets

        3. System-design discussion
           • Measures: depth of constraints considered; AI/ML component rationale

        4. Code-review simulation
           • Measures: critical reading speed; feedback style; risk detection

        5. Behavioral & collaboration interview
           • Measures: ownership; blameless culture; evidence of multiplying others

        Format your answer as:

        Stage 1 – Prompt-to-Prototype take-home
        Example question: “…”

        …through Stage 5.

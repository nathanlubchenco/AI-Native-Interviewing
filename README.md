## How to use

Clone the repo. Install [codex-cli](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11096431-openai-codex-cli-getting-started). Make any adjustments to the prompts as desired.
Ask codex-cli to generate new questions and example code as needed.  Ask for exercises in a particular language.

## Improvements and suggestions welcome
This was largely vibe coded pretty quickly, I think its more important that something like this exists at all over it being good, but it would be nice if eventually it was good too.

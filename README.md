## Motivation
Traditional software engineering interviewing has outlived the last vestiges of its usefulness.

## How to use

Clone the repo. Install [codex-cli](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11096431-openai-codex-cli-getting-started). Make any adjustments to the prompts in codex.md as desired. 
Ask codex-cli to generate new questions and example code as needed.  Ask for exercises in a particular language: default is python. Ask for the desired level: default is mid_level.  

## Improvements and suggestions welcome
This was largely vibe coded pretty quickly, I think its more important that something like this exists at all over it being good, but it would be nice if eventually it was good too.

## Limitations
These problems are simply not hard enough. Maybe some more prompting or more itertaion would get closer to whats needed. Consider this a well-intentioned proof of concept, but needing some more effort.

# AI-Native-Interviewing
An opinionated guide to evaluating engineers in the age of AI

## Motivation
Traditional software engineering interviewing has outlived the last vestiges of its usefulness.  

Insipred by this [o3 response](https://chatgpt.com/share/681ea2a8-3be8-8003-9c7c-f54644fc21a3) (I don't think I was even leading it too much)

## How to use

Clone the repo. Install [codex-cli](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11096431-openai-codex-cli-getting-started). Make any adjustments to the prompts in codex.md as desired or replace the prompt output plaintext file with something that matches your objectives and values better, this was just the first response to o3 and is not optimized or fully thought through. 
Ask codex-cli to generate new questions and example code as needed.  Ask for exercises in a particular language: default is python. Ask for the desired level: default is mid_level.  

## Improvements and suggestions welcome
This was largely vibe coded pretty quickly, I think its more important that something like this exists at all over it being good, but it would be nice if eventually it was good too.

## Limitations
The example problems are not tested, they may not be that good or solve the problem we hope them too. Maybe some more prompting or more itertaion would get closer to whats needed. Consider this a well-intentioned proof of concept, but needing some more effort. If you do happen to try any of them or use them, feedback welcome, especially around how to improve the prompt itself rather than the underlying examples which are really just intended as illustrative guides of whats possible.

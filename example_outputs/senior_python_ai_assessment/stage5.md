Stage 5 – Behavioral & collaboration interview

Example question: “You join a team whose critical microservice failed in production due to a cascading bug. Walk me through how you would take ownership to triage and resolve the incident, facilitate a blameless postmortem, and multiply the team’s knowledge to prevent future regressions. Follow-up prompts:
  - What is your immediate first step upon learning of the incident?
  - How do you gather diagnostic information while maintaining team morale?
  - How would you communicate status and escalations to stakeholders?
  - If you discover the failure was due to a library upgrade, how do you coordinate a rollback or patch?
  - Describe how you would lead a postmortem meeting to ensure psychological safety.
  - What metrics and alerts would you establish post-incident?
  - How would you document the incident and share learnings across teams?
  - How would you mentor or coach a junior engineer who played a role in the regression?
  - What process changes would you propose to prevent similar bugs?
  - How would you advocate for better testing or simulation environments?
  - How do you ensure the team feels empowered rather than blamed?
  - Describe an example from your past where you successfully multiplied a team’s capabilities through mentorship or tooling.”

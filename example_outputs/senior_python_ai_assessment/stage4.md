Stage 4 – Code-review simulation

Example question: “Review the code in `question4/vulnerable_db.py`. Identify security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection), performance or resource issues, and deviations from best practices. Suggest improvements and rewrite the example functions using parameterized queries and connection management best practices.”

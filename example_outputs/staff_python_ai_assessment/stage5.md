Stage 5 – Behavioral & collaboration interview

Example question:
“As a staff engineer, you’ve been tasked with leading the migration of a monolithic Python application to a microservices architecture across multiple product teams. Walk through how you would:
  1. Establish a shared vision, success metrics, and clear scope for the migration.
  2. Align engineering, product, and business stakeholders on priorities and timelines.
  3. Architect a phased rollout strategy (e.g., canary, blue/green deployments) to minimize risk.
  4. Define service boundaries, API contracts, and data ownership.
  5. Ensure transactional integrity and consistency across services (e.g., saga patterns).
  6. Mentor and guide teams on best practices for API design, observability, and security.
  7. Set up governance for shared libraries, coding standards, and automated quality gates.
  8. Manage cross-team dependencies and negotiate priorities.
  9. Facilitate a blameless risk assessment and post-launch retrospectives.
 10. Implement metrics, tracing, and alerts to measure impact and detect regressions.
 11. Handle pushback from teams concerned about tooling instability or learning curve.
 12. Scale documentation, training, and forums to onboard 50+ engineers.
 13. Share examples from past experiences where you influenced large-scale architectural change and multiplied team capabilities.”

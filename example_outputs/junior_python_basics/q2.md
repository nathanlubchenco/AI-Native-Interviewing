 # Stage 2 – Live Debugging Drill

 You’re given a Python script that calls a third-party API to fetch user profiles but intermittently raises `KeyError: 'email'` due to missing fields. In a 20-minute pairing session:

 1. Reproduce the error locally.
 2. Formulate and test hypotheses for why `'email'` might be missing or renamed.
 3. Implement a safe fallback or validation to prevent the crash.
 4. Write or update a minimal test to guard against regressions.

 Focus on rapid hypothesis loops, building safety nets (tests/logs), and leveraging AI-assisted debugging.

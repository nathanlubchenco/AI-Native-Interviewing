 # Stage 4 â€“ Code-Review Simulation

 You have a two-file Python change adding batch processing to an ETL pipeline:

 **`batcher.py`**
 ```python
 def batch(items, size):
     batches = []
     for i in range(0, len(items), size):
         batches.append(items[i:i+size])
     return batches
 ```

 **`processor.py`**
 ```python
 from batcher import batch

 def process_all(items, size):
     for b in batch(items, size):
         for item in items:
             process(item)
 ```

 Provide a GitHub-style code review:
 - Identify functional bugs or logic errors.
 - Suggest style or idiomatic improvements.
 - Recommend tests for edge cases and failure modes.

 # Stage 3 â€“ System-Design Discussion

 Design an in-memory caching library in Python for a microservice handling ~1,000 QPS. Requirements:
 - TTL-based eviction.
 - Optional size-based eviction (LRU).
 - Thread-safe access.
 - Metrics for cache hits/misses.

 Describe:
 - Module and package structure.
 - Key classes or data structures.
 - Concurrency controls (e.g. locks, queues).
 - Your testing strategy (unit tests, load tests).
